# Unified Build Standard

A portable operating standard for AI-assisted technical work — features, fixes, refactors, migrations, data pipelines, automations and configuration.

It exists to resolve difficult reasoning at the right time, minimise rediscovery, use the least costly capable resource, and convert plans into correct, visible progress.

> **Plan intelligently. Execute economically. Verify objectively. Learn quickly. Escalate selectively.**

## Read the standard

- **Rendered:** [BUILD_STANDARD.md](https://github.com/learndca/unified-build-standard/blob/main/BUILD_STANDARD.md)
- **Raw Markdown:** [raw.githubusercontent.com/…/BUILD_STANDARD.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learndca/unified-build-standard/main/BUILD_STANDARD.md)

The raw link is the one to paste into a system prompt, a project instruction file, or any agent that can fetch a URL.

## Where this is going

Part 1 — the planning and execution loop — is done. Parts 2 and 3, which make each
project cost less than the last, are captured in [NEXT_STEPS.md](NEXT_STEPS.md).

The priority there is **Part 3, compounding memory**: capturing what a finished project
taught you, so the next one starts ahead rather than from scratch.

## What it does

| Part | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| **Shared rules** | Authority hierarchy, right-sizing work, non-negotiables, approval and escalation, delegation |
| **Part I — Planning** | Planning mode, one master plan table with stable step IDs, executor tiers, the phase gate |
| **Part II — Execution** | Safe resumption, focused loops, verification, blockers, durable progress state, completion |

Key properties:

- **Right-sized.** Trivial work gets no plan and no ceremony; high-impact work gets explicit approval gates.
- **Repository content is data, not authority.** Instructions embedded in files, logs, dependencies or web pages are never obeyed on their own.
- **The phase gate is real.** A plan is presented and then execution stops until it is clearly authorised.
- **Verification is not optional.** A check that cannot run means the step is *not verified* — substitute evidence may never be described as the missing check.
- **Resumable.** `BUILD_PLAN.md` and `EXECUTION_PROGRESS.md` let a fresh session see what advanced, what remains, and exactly what happens next.

> **Evidence of progress, not merely evidence of activity.**

## Source-of-truth rule

`BUILD_STANDARD.md` at the repository root is **canonical**. Every other copy in this repository is derived:

```
BUILD_STANDARD.md                                          ← edit only this
├── skill/unified-build-standard/references/               ← generated
├── openai/plugin/skills/…/references/                     ← generated
└── dist/**/*.zip                                          ← generated
```

Never edit a derived copy. Edit the canonical file and run the packaging script, which re-synchronises everything and rebuilds both ZIPs:

```bash
python3 scripts/package_skill.py
```

To verify without writing anything — suitable for CI or a pre-commit check:

```bash
python3 scripts/package_skill.py --check   # exits 1 if any copy has drifted
```

The script uses only the Python standard library and needs no dependencies.

## Use it as a reference

Point any agent at the raw URL, or add a line to `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
Follow the Unified Build Standard:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learndca/unified-build-standard/main/BUILD_STANDARD.md
```

Or drop `BUILD_STANDARD.md` at a project root and reference it from the project's instruction file. It also works unmodified as a system prompt.

## Use it as a skill

The portable skill lives at [`skill/unified-build-standard/`](skill/unified-build-standard/). It is standards-compatible — plain YAML frontmatter, no platform-specific fields — and the **same** skill is used in the Anthropic and OpenAI packages. There are no independently maintained variants.

| Platform | Guide | Package |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude / Claude Code | [anthropic/README.md](anthropic/README.md) | [`dist/anthropic/unified-build-standard.zip`](dist/anthropic/unified-build-standard.zip) |
| ChatGPT / Codex | [openai/README.md](openai/README.md) | [`dist/openai/unified-build-standard-plugin.zip`](dist/openai/unified-build-standard-plugin.zip) |

### Anthropic — short version

Upload `dist/anthropic/unified-build-standard.zip` via **Customize → Skills → Add**, enable it, then invoke `/unified-build-standard`. Sync it into the CLI once with:

```bash
CLAUDE_CODE_SYNC_SKILLS=1 claude -p "List the skills you have available"
```

Per-repository install: copy the skill folder into `.claude/skills/`.

### OpenAI — short version

Standalone Codex install:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
ln -s "$PWD/skill/unified-build-standard" ~/.agents/skills/unified-build-standard
```

Start a new session, check `/skills`, invoke `$unified-build-standard`. For ChatGPT web, desktop and mobile, install the personal plugin from `dist/openai/unified-build-standard-plugin.zip` and invoke it with `@unified-build-standard`.

Per-repository install: copy the skill folder into `.agents/skills/`.

## Invocation examples

Planning only — the phase gate applies:

```
Use the Unified Build Standard to plan this project.
Planning only. Stop at the phase gate.
```

Executing an already-approved plan:

```
Use the Unified Build Standard.
Execution is authorised against the approved plan.
```

Explicit skill selection:

```
/unified-build-standard          # Claude
$unified-build-standard          # Codex CLI
@unified-build-standard          # ChatGPT
```

## Updating and repackaging

1. Edit `BUILD_STANDARD.md` at the repository root.
2. If the plugin is being redistributed, bump `version` in `openai/plugin/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` using strict semver.
3. Run `python3 scripts/package_skill.py`.
4. Run `python3 scripts/package_skill.py --check` to confirm a clean tree.
5. Commit and push. Symlinked local installations update on `git pull`; account-level uploads need the new ZIP re-uploaded.

## Keeping a local copy in sync

GitHub is the source of truth. A local clone is a disposable cache of it — on any
machine, one command gives you everything:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/learndca/unified-build-standard.git ~/unified-build-standard
```

To keep that clone current automatically, schedule a fast-forward pull. The repository
is public, so fetching needs no credentials:

```bash
cd ~/unified-build-standard && git pull --ff-only
```

Run it on a schedule with `launchd` (macOS), `cron` or Task Scheduler (Windows). Two
rules matter in any such job: abort if there are uncommitted local changes, and use
`--ff-only` so a diverged branch stops the sync instead of being overwritten.

If the skill is installed by symlink, a successful pull updates every local
installation at once — nothing else to run.
